# Designer Workflow Rules

## Do
- Use shadcn/ui components exclusively (never create custom buttons/cards)
- Use Tailwind utility classes for all styling
- Keep components small and focused (one section = one component)
- Use semantic HTML (header, section, article, footer)
- Make all components responsive by default (mobile-first)
- Use the 8px spacing scale (p-2, p-4, p-8, etc.)

## Don't
- Don't create inline styles or style tags
- Don't use divs when semantic HTML exists
- Don't hardcode colors (use Tailwind color classes)
- Don't create complex nested structures (keep shallow)

## Component Patterns
- Forms: Use shadcn/ui Form + react-hook-form
- Images: Always include alt text and use aspect-ratio classes
- Sections: Container with max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4
- Buttons: Use shadcn Button component with appropriate variants

## File Organization
- Marketing sections go in src/components/sections/
- Reusable UI in src/components/ui/ (shadcn)
- Pages in src/pages/
